## Description ##
This program is a simpled daily planner for your work-day. It starts at 9am, standard work day, and ends at 5pm. The hours will highlight diffrent colors depending on what hour you are on. The items will be saved in local storage so that when the page is refreshed the items you have entered will still stay in the block. The page has a save button on the side in order to perfrom this save. The application will pull the users current date and time and diplay it on the top of the page. This will also come in handy when the application is used in other times zones as it will change based on the users computer settings.
